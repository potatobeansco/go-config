# config

This package provides additional components in order to read environment variables quite easily. It is used to create
12-factor apps. Almost all Go backend services written by PotatoBeans are 12-factor apps which are required to read
configurations from environment variables. This package allows parsing environment variables directly into a struct.

It has now been released to be used by everyone including all PotatoBeans clients as open source.
